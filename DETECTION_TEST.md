# Enhanced Detection System - Quick Test

## What's New

✅ **80+ Detection Objects** - All COCO dataset objects
✅ **Detection Monitor** - Publishes "no detection" status every 2 seconds  
✅ **Enhanced CLI** - Shows detection status messages
✅ **Optimized Thresholds** - High/medium/low sensitivity levels

## Test Setup

### Terminal 1: Start Webcam Stream
```bash
cd /home/rusty/sensei/VidOxide
./stream-webcam.sh
```

### Terminal 2: Run Detection Monitor
```bash
make monitor
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🔍 Detection Monitor starting...
📡 Subscribed to frigate/events
🔇 No detections - published status
🔇 No detections - published status
✅ Detection active: cup (1729563911.123-abc)
🎯 Active detections: 1
```

### Terminal 3: Run Enhanced CLI
```bash
make cli
```

**Expected Output:**
```

🎯 new: cup detected on demo (confidence: 45.2%) [id: 1729563911.123-abc]
🎯 update: cup detected on demo (confidence: 47.8%) [id: 1729563911.123-abc]

## Detection Objects by Category

### People & Animals (16 objects)
- person, cat, dog, horse, sheep, cow, elephant, bear, zebra, giraffe, bird

### Vehicles (8 objects)
- bicycle, car, motorcycle, airplane, bus, train, truck, boat

### Food & Kitchen (18 objects)

### Sports (10 objects)
- frisbee, skis, snowboard, sports ball, kite, baseball bat, baseball glove, skateboard, surfboard, tennis racket

## Sensitivity Levels

### High Sensitivity (Person)
```yaml
person:
  min_area: 30        # Small size OK
  threshold: 0.35     # 35% confidence minimum
```

### Medium Sensitivity (Animals, Vehicles)
```yaml
car:
  min_area: 100
  threshold: 0.4      # 40% confidence
```

### Low Sensitivity (Small Objects)
```yaml
cell phone:
  min_area: 20        # Very small OK
  threshold: 0.3      # 30% confidence
```

## Test Objects Around You

Try holding these in front of your webcam:
- ✅ **Cell phone** - Should detect immediately
- ✅ **Cup/Mug** - High detection rate
- ✅ **Book** - Easy to detect
- ✅ **Remote control** - Should work
- ✅ **Laptop** - If in view
- ✅ **Your face** - Person detection (wave hands!)

## Monitor Topics

The detection monitor publishes to:
```
Topic: frigate/demo/detection_status
Interval: Every 2 seconds (when idle)
```

Subscribe manually:
```bash
docker exec vi_mosquitto mosquitto_sub -t "frigate/demo/detection_status" -v
```

## Troubleshooting

### No "idle" messages showing?
```bash
# Check if monitor is running
ps aux | grep detection-monitor

# Check MQTT broker
docker logs vi_mosquitto --tail 20
```

### Not detecting objects?
1. Check Frigate is receiving stream:
   ```bash
   curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/stats | jq '.cameras.demo.detection_fps'
   ```

2. Open Frigate UI: http://localhost:5000
   - Check live feed
   - Look for bounding boxes

3. Lower thresholds further in `compose/frigate.yml`

### CLI not showing status messages?
Make sure you're subscribed to all topics:
```bash
./target/release/frigate-cli --topic "frigate/#"
```

## Expected Behavior

**With objects in view:**
- ✅ CLI shows detections with confidence scores
- ✅ Monitor tracks active detections
- ✅ No "idle" messages

**Without objects:**
- ✅ Monitor publishes idle status every 2 seconds
- ✅ CLI shows "💤 No objects detected"
- ✅ Last detection time tracked

## Performance

- **Detection FPS**: 5 fps (adjustable in frigate.yml)
- **Objects tracked**: 80+ COCO dataset classes
- **Idle check**: Every 2 seconds
- **CPU usage**: ~3-5% (software inference)

## Next Steps

1. **Multi-camera**: Add more cameras to frigate.yml
2. **Zones**: Define detection zones (yard, driveway, etc.)
3. **Notifications**: Integrate with notification services
4. **Storage**: Store events in SQLite/Postgres
5. **Analytics**: Track detection patterns over time
