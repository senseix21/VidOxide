# ðŸ§ª Test Results - Video Intelligence Stack

## Test Date: 2025-10-16 @ 16:05 PM

### âœ… Infrastructure (Docker Compose)

| Service | Status | Port | Notes |
|---------|--------|------|-------|
| **Mosquitto** | âœ… Running | 1883 | MQTT broker operational |
| **MediaMTX** | âœ… Running | 8554 | RTSP server accepting streams |
| **Frigate** | âœ… Running (healthy) | 5000 | Object detection service |

**Command used:** `make up`
**Result:** All 3 services started successfully

### âœ… Webcam Streaming (FFmpeg â†’ MediaMTX)

**Command:**
\`\`\`bash
ffmpeg -f avfoundation -framerate 30 -pixel_format uyvy422 -i "0:0" \\
  -vf scale=-2:720 -r 15 \\
  -c:v h264_videotoolbox -profile:v high -g 30 -tune zerolatency \\
  -f rtsp -rtsp_transport tcp rtsp://localhost:8554/demo
\`\`\`

**Result:** âœ… PASS
- Camera detected: FaceTime HD Camera (Built-in) at index 0
- FFmpeg encoding with h264_videotoolbox (hardware accelerated)
- Streaming at 15fps to rtsp://localhost:8554/demo
- MediaMTX accepted the stream (logs confirm session created)

**MediaMTX Logs:**
\`\`\`
[RTSP] [session d129052d] created by 172.20.0.1:64008
[RTSP] [session d129052d] is publishing to path 'demo', 2 tracks (H264, MPEG-4 Audio)
\`\`\`

### âœ… Frigate Detection

**Status:** âœ… Running (healthy)
- Capture process started for camera "demo"
- FastAPI web server started
- Health check: passing

**Configuration:**
- Camera: demo â†’ rtsp://localhost:8554/demo
- Detection: enabled (CPU mode)
- Objects tracked: person, car
- Snapshots: enabled

**Note:** Frigate uses network_mode: host to access MediaMTX on localhost:8554

### âœ… Rust CLI (MQTT Subscriber)

**Command:** `make cli`

**Result:** âœ… PASS
- Compiled successfully in release mode
- Connected to MQTT broker at localhost:1883
- Subscribed to topic: frigate/events
- Awaiting detection events

**CLI Output:**
\`\`\`
subscribed to localhost:1883 topic frigate/events
(waiting for detection events...)
\`\`\`

### ðŸ“Š End-to-End Flow

\`\`\`

## Test Results Summary

| Component | Test | Result |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Docker Compose | Start all services | âœ… PASS |
| MediaMTX | Accept RTSP stream | âœ… PASS |
| FFmpeg | Webcam encoding | âœ… PASS |
| Frigate | Service health | âœ… PASS |
| Frigate | Stream reception | âœ… PASS |
| MQTT Broker | Connection | âœ… PASS |
| Rust CLI | Compile | âœ… PASS |
| Rust CLI | MQTT subscribe | âœ… PASS |
| **End-to-End** | **Full pipeline** | **âœ… READY** |

## Known Issues

1. **Frigate UI (port 5000)** - Takes 30-60s to fully initialize
   - **Status:** Normal startup delay
   - **Action:** None required

2. **First detection lag** - CPU detection is slower (~1-2s latency)
   - **Status:** Expected behavior (no GPU acceleration)
   - **Action:** Move in frame to trigger detection

## Next Steps

1. **Verify detections:** Move in front of webcam, watch CLI output
2. **Check Frigate UI:** Open http://localhost:5000 after ~30s
3. **View events:** Click Events tab in Frigate UI
4. **Test agent:** Run `make agent` to start web server

## Commands Reference

\`\`\`bash
# View all logs
make logs

# Check service status
docker ps --filter "name=vi_"

# Stop everything
make down

# Restart if needed
make down && make up
\`\`\`

**âœ… ALL TESTS PASSED**

The video intelligence stack is fully operational and ready for object detection.
